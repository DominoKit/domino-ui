/**
 * The {@code Selectable} interface represents an object that can be selected or deselected. It
 * provides methods to manipulate the selection state and query the current selection status.
 *
 * <p>Implementing classes or objects that implement this interface should provide mechanisms to
 * track and manage their selection state.
 *
 * <p>This interface defines the following methods to work with selection:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #select()}: Selects the object.
 *   <li>{@link #deselect()}: Deselects the object.
 *   <li>{@link #select(boolean)}: Selects the object, optionally in silent mode (without triggering
 *       events).
 *   <li>{@link #deselect(boolean)}: Deselects the object, optionally in silent mode (without
 *       triggering events).
 *   <li>{@link #isSelected()}: Checks if the object is currently selected.
 *   <li>{@link #isSelectable()}: Checks if the object is selectable.
 *   <li>{@link #setSelectable(boolean)}: Sets the object's selectability status.
 *   <li>{@link #setSelected(boolean)}: Sets the object as selected or deselected.
 *   <li>{@link #setSelected(boolean, boolean)}: Sets the object as selected or deselected,
 *       optionally in silent mode (without triggering events).
 *   <li>{@link #toggleSelect()}: Toggles the selection state of the object.
 *   <li>{@link #toggleSelect(boolean)}: Toggles the selection state of the object, optionally in
 *       silent mode.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Implementing classes should provide proper implementations of these methods to manage
 * selection and selectability as per their specific requirements.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the object that can be selected or deselected.
