/**
 * The {@code Category} enum represents different categories or types of filters that can be applied
 * in a DataTable.
 *
 * <p>Filters in a DataTable can be categorized into two main categories:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>SEARCH: This category is used for filters that are applied to the DataTable's search
 *       functionality. Filters in this category are typically used to search for specific data
 *       within the DataTable.
 *   <li>HEADER_FILTER: This category is used for filters that are applied to the DataTable's header
 *       columns. Filters in this category are typically used to filter data based on
 *       column-specific criteria, such as filtering by date, number, or text within a specific
 *       column.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>You can use these categories to classify and organize filters within your DataTable, making it
 * easier to manage and apply different types of filters to your data.
