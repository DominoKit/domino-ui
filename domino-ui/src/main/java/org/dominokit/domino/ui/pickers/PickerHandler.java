/**
 * A functional interface representing a handler for picker-related events.
 *
 * <p>The {@code PickerHandler} interface defines a single method, {@code handle()}, that should be
 * implemented to define the behavior of a picker-related event.
 *
 * <p>Usage example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Define a PickerHandler to handle a picker event
 * PickerHandler pickerHandler = () -> {
 *     // Perform some action when the picker event occurs
 *     // ...
 * };
 *
 * // Use the PickerHandler in a picker component
 * pickerComponent.setPickerHandler(pickerHandler);
 * </pre>
 *
