/**
 * An interface representing a parent node in a tree-like structure. Defines the minimal contract
 * for a node that can hold children, expand to show them, and integrate into a root tree hierarchy.
 *
 * <p>Methods:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #getRootNode()} - obtains the {@link RootNode} that this node ultimately belongs to
 *   <li>{@link #expandNode()} / {@link #expandNode(boolean)} - expands this node (and optionally
 *       parent nodes)
 *   <li>{@link #getFilter()} - retrieves the filter logic used to determine visibility/matching
 *       (e.g., for search)
 *   <li>{@link #getParent()} - returns the parent node, if any
 *   <li>{@link #removeNode(TreeNode)} - removes a child node
 *   <li>{@link #getValue()} / {@link #setValue(Object)} - manages the data value associated with
 *       this node
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This interface also extends {@link HasActiveNode} to provide for activation (focus/selection)
 * logic at the parent level.
 *
 * @param <V> the type of data value or model object stored in nodes
 * @param <N> the node type (e.g., a concrete subclass of {@link TreeNode})
 * @param <S> the selection type, often the same as the node type or a collection of nodes
