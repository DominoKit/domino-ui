/**
 * The {@code ScreenMedia} enum represents different screen media query states that can be used for
 * responsive web design. These media query states are typically used in conjunction with CSS to
 * apply styles based on the screen size.
 *
 * <p>This enum provides constants for various screen media query states, making it easier to work
 * with responsive design in the Domino UI framework.
 *
 * <p>The available screen media query states are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #XSMALL_ONLY}: For extra-small screens only.
 *   <li>{@link #XSMALL_AND_UP}: For extra-small screens and larger.
 *   <li>{@link #SMALL_ONLY}: For small screens only.
 *   <li>{@link #SMALL_AND_DOWN}: For small screens and smaller.
 *   <li>{@link #SMALL_AND_UP}: For small screens and larger.
 *   <li>{@link #MEDIUM_ONLY}: For medium screens only.
 *   <li>{@link #MEDIUM_AND_DOWN}: For medium screens and smaller.
 *   <li>{@link #MEDIUM_AND_UP}: For medium screens and larger.
 *   <li>{@link #LARGE_ONLY}: For large screens only.
 *   <li>{@link #LARGE_AND_DOWN}: For large screens and smaller.
 *   <li>{@link #LARGE_AND_UP}: For large screens and larger.
 *   <li>{@link #XLARGE_ONLY}: For extra-large screens only.
 *   <li>{@link #XLARGE_AND_DOWN}: For extra-large screens and smaller.
 *   <li>{@link #XLARGE_AND_UP}: For extra-large screens and larger.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Each enum constant corresponds to a specific screen media query state and provides a {@code
 * style} that can be used in CSS classes or styles to apply responsive design.
 *
 * <p>For more information about responsive design and media queries, refer to the <a
 * href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries" target="_blank">MDN
 * documentation</a>.
